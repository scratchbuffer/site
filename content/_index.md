Welcome!

The site design is a work in progress, as you can see.
Hopefully this basic Hugo theme and built-in browser styles will not be too hard on the eyes.

Content will be migrated incrementally from [francoposa.io](https://francoposa.io),
and completely new content will continue to be added as well.

In the meantime, check out the first post:

**[Modern TypeScript Project Setup with NPM, Part 1](/topics/web-development/typescript-npm-setup-part-1/)**.
