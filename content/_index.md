Welcome!

The site design is a work in progress, as you can see.
Please excuse the minimal styling while we work.

The content here takes two forms: Articles and Note Cards.

**Articles** are classic, full-length posts: details guides, tutorials, or deep dives into a concept.

**Note Cards** provide tips, tricks, or quick solutions to common issues -
copy and paste the solution and be on your way, or stick around for a short explanation and references.

Articles will be migrated incrementally from [francoposa.io](https://francoposa.io),
and completely new content will continue to be added as well.

In the meantime, check out the first few posts:

* _**[Modern TypeScript Project Setup with NPM, Part 1](/topics/web-development/typescript-npm-setup-part-1/)**_
* _**[Python Setup for Linux with Pyenv](/topics/python/python-setup-linux/)**_
